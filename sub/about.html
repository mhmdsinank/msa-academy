      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-12"><img src="../public/R.jfif" class="img-fluid" style="margin-top:10px ;margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid; height: 700px;"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-6 col-12"><p>The history of martial arts in India is ancient and diverse, deeply intertwined with its rich cultural and religious heritage. Here's an overview of the development and significance of martial arts in India:<br>

        <strong>1. Ancient Roots:</strong> Martial arts in India trace back thousands of years, with references found in ancient texts such as the Vedas, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and various treatises on warfare and combat. These texts mention combat techniques, weapon training, and martial arts principles.<br>
        
        <strong>2. Kalaripayattu:</strong> Considered one of the oldest martial arts in the world, Kalaripayattu originated in the southern Indian state of Kerala. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, including strikes, kicks, grappling, and weapons training. Kalaripayattu is not only a physical discipline but also incorporates elements of yoga, meditation, and Ayurveda (traditional Indian medicine).<br>
        
        <strong>3. Silambam:</strong> Originating in the Tamil Nadu region, Silambam is a traditional Indian martial art focused on staff fighting. Practitioners use bamboo staffs (silambam) as well as other weapons like swords, spears, and knives. Silambam techniques emphasize agility, footwork, and timing.<br>
        
        <strong>4. Gatka:</strong> Gatka is a martial art associated with the Sikh community, particularly in the Punjab region. It originated as a combat system for Sikh warriors to defend themselves and their faith against adversaries. Gatka incorporates sword fighting, stick fighting, and unarmed combat techniques.<br>
        
        <strong>5. Thang-Ta:</strong> Thang-Ta is a martial art from the northeastern Indian states of Manipur and Assam. It combines armed combat (thang) with empty-hand techniques (ta). Practitioners learn to wield weapons such as swords, spears, and shields, as well as unarmed striking and grappling techniques.<br>
        
        <strong>6. Other Regional Styles:</strong> India's vast cultural diversity has given rise to numerous regional martial arts styles, each with its unique techniques, training methods, and cultural significance. These include Malla-yuddha (wrestling), Musti-yuddha (boxing), and various folk martial arts practiced in different parts of the country.<br>
        
        <strong>7. Influence and Preservation:</strong> Over the centuries, Indian martial arts have influenced and been influenced by neighboring cultures, such as those of Southeast Asia and Central Asia. Despite facing challenges from colonialism and modernization, efforts have been made to preserve and promote traditional Indian martial arts through training schools, cultural festivals, and government support.<br>
        
        Today, Indian martial arts continue to be practiced both as a means of self-defense and as a way to preserve cultural heritage and promote physical fitness and well-being. They serve as a reminder of India's rich martial tradition and its enduring influence on combat systems worldwide.</p></div>
